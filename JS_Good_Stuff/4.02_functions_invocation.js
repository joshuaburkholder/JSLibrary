//When a function is invoked, the current function is suspended and the
//parameters are passed to the new function. 

//In addition to the parameters of a function, every function also recieves
//"this" and "argument" parameters. The value of "this" parameter is determined
//by the "invocation pattern"

//There are FOUR INVOCATION PATTERNS in JavaScript:
//  1. Method Invocation
//  2. Function Invocation
//  3. Constructor Invocoation
//  4. Apply Invocation

//The INVOCATION OPERATOR is (). These () may contain zero (or more!)
//expressions, separated by comma(s). 
//Each value of the arguement will be assigned to the function's parameters.
//If there are too many argument values, the extras will be ignored.
//If there are too few argument values, the missing values of the parameters
//will be returned "undefined."
