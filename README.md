# JSLibrary

This library contains notes and collections of codes from my ongoing reading and learning JavaScript:

*The Good Parts*
The main library consists of notes and examples on "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford.
The numbering of these files reflects the chapters and sections as they are laid out in the book, to 
facilitate quick reference.

*Function Library*
This is one of the places I store random code and snippets that I might want to reference later on.

*Node Basics*
This is a defunct library that contains a few files that were part of my learning Node.js

*patterns*
This is another place where I store patterns for functions, code snippets, and the like for future reference.

*project_euler*
This is where I place code for Project Euler problems.
